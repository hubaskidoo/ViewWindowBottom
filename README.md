When I see a link in my email, I want to see where the link goes before clicking on it.
However, most browsers tend to push the window's bottom below the screen's bottom so the information is 
obscured. 

This extension resizes the browser's window so that the window's bottom is visible which makes
the link's url visible as well.

To install the extension in Chrome or Brave, follow the instructions below. For other browsers, look up
instructions on how to load an extension for that browser.

1) Download the three files, manifest.js, manifest.json and background.js to a common folder. 
2) Click the extension icon to expose the browser's extension menu.
3) Select Manage Extensions.
4) Click "Load Unpacked" button
5) Browse to the folder you stored the three files in.
6) Select the folder (not the files)

To Use the extension, press ctrl-u. The window will resize.

To modify the keystroke.
You can alter the background.js file to look for a different keystroke
